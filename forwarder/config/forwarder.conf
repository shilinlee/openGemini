  ##
  ## For example, if each message from the queue contains 10 metrics and the
  ## output metric_batch_size is 1000, setting this to 100 will ensure that a
  ## full batch is collected and the write is triggered immediately without
  ## waiting until the next flush_interval.

  ## Maximum amount of time the consumer should take to process messages. If
  ## the debug log prints messages from sarama about 'abandoning subscription
  ## to [topic] because consuming was taking too long', increase this value to
  ## longer than the time taken by the output plugin(s).

  ## The default number of message bytes to fetch from the broker in each
  ## request (default 1MB). This should be larger than the majority of

  ## negotiating sizes and not actually consuming. Similar to the JVM's
  ## `fetch.message.max.bytes`.
  # consumer_fetch_default = "1MB"
