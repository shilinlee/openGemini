# openGemini-forwarder
High-performance data access middleware. For example, Kafka data can be consumed, converted and written into openGemini.



## Quick Start

This section mainly contains the following:

- How to compile forwarder source code
- How to run forwarder 



### Compiling environment information

[GO](https://golang.org/dl/) version v1.18+

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version v3.7+

**How to set GO environment variables**

Open ~/.profile configuration file and add the following configurations to the end of the file:

```
export GOPATH=/path/to/dir
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export GO111MODULE=on
export GONOSUMDB=*
export GOSUMDB=off
```



### Compiling

1. Clone source codes from Github

```
> cd $GOPATH
> mkdir -p {pkg,bin,src}
> cd src
> git clone https://github.com/openGemini/openGemini-forwarder.git
```

1. Enter the home directory

```
> cd openGemini-forwarder
```

1. Compiling

```
> python build.py --clean
```

The compiled binary file is in the build directory

```
> ls build
ts-forwarder
```



### Configuration

The configuration file is in the config directory. 

### Run forwarder

Standalone operation

```
> mkdir -p /tmp/openGemini/logs/
```
